### Cherry-Pick

If you have a very important change in a branch, but that branch is not merged yet, you can use `cherry picking`.

You use that if you want to work with that change, but instead of merging that branch, you *cherry-pick* that commit with the important change.
```
git cherry-pick <commit hash>
```

You usually avoid cherry picking. You do this only in exceptions.
