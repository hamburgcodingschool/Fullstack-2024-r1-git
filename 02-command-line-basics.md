## Command line basics

We will learn git on the command line.

For that we need to open the Terminal (on Mac), or the Command Prompt (on Windows).

Alternatively, you can use the Terminal in Visual Studio Code.

Here is an overview of the basic commands that you will need frequently:

**Navigate into a directory:**
```
cd <directory>
```
Stands for: change directory  
If you want to go into the directory `Projects` you would type:
```
cd Projects
```

Navigate into the parent directory:
```
cd ..
```

**Create a new directory:**
```
mkdir <directory>
```
Stands for: make directory  
If you want to create the directory `codingschool`, you would type:
```
mkdir codingschool
```

**Create a new file:**
```
touch <file>
```
If you want to create the file `readme.txt`, you would type:
```
touch readme.txt
```

**List all files and directories:**
```
ls
```
