## GitHub Pages

You can use GitHub for publishing your website.

GitHub Pages is some sort of web space. It works with GitHub.

Instead of FTP and using a web server, we can use GitHub Pages.

For that, the repository needs to be public, or else you need to have a Pro account.

You can make a repository public on `Settings` > `Danger zone`.
