### Git Config

If you use git, you need to set up a few things before you start.   
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup

You can do that by editing the git config file:
```
cat ~/.gitconfig
```

In that file, you can add your own aliases like:
```
[alias]
    c = commit
```
