## Push and Pull

To push your local changes to your remote repository, use:
```
git push
```

If your branch is new, you need to push it to upload it:
```
git push -u origin <branch name>
```

To see if there are changes that someone else pushed to remote:
```
git fetch
```

To pull these changes to your local repository:
```
git pull
```
