## Head

If you do `git log` you see `HEAD` somewhere.  
What is this `HEAD`?

If you do checkout, you jump to a certain commit or branch.

The `HEAD` is the position where in the commit history you currently are.

If you compare it with a supermarket checkout, the HEAD is your shopping cart: the current status of what is in there.
